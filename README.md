# Mini-Project
Some codes of my academic mini-project.
The user and blood donor are immediately connected by this app.
Donors can register using this app both directly and through the administrator. Also, it enables you to look for and get in touch with the ideal donor.
Front-end uses HTML and CSS.
The back end uses PHP and MySQL.
XAMPP is used as a server and phpMyAdmin is used to handle the administration of MySQL over the Web.
